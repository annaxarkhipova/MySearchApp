This is my first project (for me as a beginner) - a creating a python GUI with radiobuttons, entries, using Urllib library and buttons.
I use the Mac OS.

Description of a task:

A user types in the search field 'tea' and chooses the browser selecting a wishful webbrowser. 
Next step is pressing on the button 'Search', the user has a browser opening with the Google results of 'tea'. That is what web search engine could find in the Internet.
